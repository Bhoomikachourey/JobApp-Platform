# Job Application Platform (Backend)

This is the backend for a job application platform. It manages companies, job listings, and reviews. Companies can post job opportunities, and users can leave ratings and reviews for those companies. The platform allows for seamless management of job data, company profiles, and review systems. Built using Spring Boot, it interacts with a database and supports CRUD operations for jobs and reviews.
